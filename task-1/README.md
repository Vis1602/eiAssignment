# Task 1: Design Patterns Implementation

This task demonstrates the implementation of various design patterns in Java. The project is organized into the following categories:

## Folder Structure

- `src/behavioral`: Contains behavioral design patterns such as Observer and Strategy.
- `src/creational`: Contains creational design patterns such as Factory and Singleton.
- `src/structural`: Contains structural design patterns such as Adapter and Decorator.

## How to Run

1. Navigate to the `src` folder.
2. Compile the Java files using `javac`.
3. Run the demo classes to see the patterns in action.

## Design Patterns Covered

- **Behavioral**: Observer, Strategy
- **Creational**: Factory, Singleton
- **Structural**: Adapter, Decorator

## Notes

- Ensure Java is installed on your system.
- Use the `bin` folder to store compiled `.class` files.
